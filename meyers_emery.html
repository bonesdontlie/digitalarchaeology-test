<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hi, I’m Katy!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am a PhD Candidate at Michigan State University in the Department of Anthropology. I have a strong background in mortuary archaeology, bioarchaeology and anthropology in general. My current focus is on co-occurrence of burial forms, using Anglo-Saxon cemeteries as a case study. I take a strong digital approach, using geographic information services and other digital tools to solve problems in new ways. This summer, I was the Assistant Director for the <a href="http://campusarch.msu.edu/ANP464FS/"><span class="s2">MSU Campus Archaeology Field School</span></a>, and helped to develop and lead the course. Over the past year, I was also the Lead Instructor for ANP 203: Introduction to Archaeology, and designed and developed my course from scratch. I also work with the MSU Graduate School to develop and run workshops and bootcamps for graduate students to create and manage their digital identities. I am a research fellow for the <a href="https://katymeyers.wordpress.com/campusarch.msu.edu"><span class="s2">Campus Archaeology Program</span></a>. I am a returning fellow in the NSF-funded <a href="http://grad.msu.edu/fast/"><span class="s2">Future Academic Scholars in Teaching (FAST) program</span></a> at MSU.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I am the creator and author of the internationally recognized blog, <a href="http://bonesdontlie.wordpress.com/"><span class="s2">Bones Don’t Lie</span></a>, a mortuary archaeology and bioarchaeology news and commentary website. I am also the co-creator and co-editor for <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/gradhacker"><span class="s2">GradHacker, an Inside Higher Ed blog</span></a>written for graduate students and by graduate students around the world.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">During my tenure at MSU have also served as the secretary and conference organizer for the <a href="https://katymeyers.wordpress.com/cogs.msu.edu"><span class="s2">Council of Graduate Students</span></a>, have been a fellow in the <a href="https://katymeyers.wordpress.com/chi.matrix.msu.edu"><span class="s2">Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative</span></a> twice, and have been <a href="https://katymeyers.wordpress.com/campusarch.msu.edu"><span class="s2">Campus Archaeologist</span></a>, a two year position which involved protection and mitigation of historic and prehistoric sites on MSU’s campus, and have been a teaching assistant.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My goal is to teach anthropology as a full time professor. I would like to focus on archaeology, and run a field school that emphasizes burial or public archaeology, as well as digital methods for sharing and preserving heritage. I am dedicated to improving my teaching, and have been conducting research on my ow teaching over the past year. I hope to continue to merge my interests in mortuary archaeology, digital archaeology and public engagement into my career.</span></p>
